# =============================================================================
# Categories of Machine Learning
# =============================================================================

two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Supervised learning:-
    classification tasks
    regression task

Unsupervised learning
    clustering and dimensionality reduction

semi-supervised learning methods

# =============================================================================
# Qualitative Examples of Machine Learning Applications
# =============================================================================

#Classification: Predicting discrete labels
you are given a set of labeled points and want to use these to classify 
some unlabeled points.
usually 0 or 1, malignent or beneign
 Here the model is a quantitative version of the statement 
 "a straight line separates the classes".
 
#Regression: Predicting continuous labels
 means a equation 
 house prices
 
# =============================================================================
# Summary
# =============================================================================
In short, we saw the following:

1-Supervised learning: Models that can predict labels based on labeled training data

Classification: Models that predict labels as two or more discrete categories
Regression: Models that predict continuous labels

2-Unsupervised learning: Models that identify structure in unlabeled data

Clustering: Models that detect and identify distinct groups in the data
Dimensionality reduction: Models that detect and identify lower-dimensional structure in higher-dimensional data
